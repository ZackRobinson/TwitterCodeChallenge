# TwitterCodeChallenge
Weather app for Twitter. 

Twitter uses a Java codebase for their Android app that makes web service requests with RxJava. This submission is intended to demonstrate integration of a Java codebase with Kotlin. They gave me 3 hours to finish and told me they weren't grading the design of the layouts. Please see this link for a list of their requirements. http://zackeryrobinson.com/twitter_weather_app_challenge.pdf
